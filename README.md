## Infrastructure Assignment

Welcome to this infrastructure assignment, designed to test your foundational skills in Kubernetes and Terraform, along with essential networking concepts. The assignment consists of four focused exercises, each targeting a different aspect of these technologies.

### Tools and Prerequisites

To successfully complete this assignment, you will need the following tools:

- **Kubernetes Cluster Toolkit**:
  - [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start), [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), or any other tool you are comfortable with for deploying a local Kubernetes cluster.

- **Development and Monitoring Tools**:
  - [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/): A tool for simplifying multi-service development on Kubernetes.
  - [k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/): A versatile load testing tool for testing the reliability and performance of your deployments.

- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

Note that while Tilt and k6 are not strictly required, they can greatly assist in testing and validating your Kubernetes configurations and performance.

### Assignment Overview

Each exercise is designed to incrementally test your understanding and capabilities in deploying and managing infrastructure:

1. **Deploy and manage a basic Kubernetes application.**
2. **Expose and monitor application metrics.**
3. **Implement dynamic scaling with Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).**
4. **Provision and configure AWS infrastructure using Terraform.**

Good luck, and enjoy!
